# Word Search Game!

This is my Word Search Game. I created it programmatically in the Swift language.

## How To Play:

- There are 6 words to find in the grid of letters: Swift, Kotlin, ObjectiveC, Variable, Java, Mobile.
- Tap on an unselected letter to select it. You can tap on a selected letter again to unselect it.

## How I Made It:
- It's a single view iOS app made through XCode.
- The word data is fed into a collection view, and I created an algorithm to randomize the words and letters on a the grid.
